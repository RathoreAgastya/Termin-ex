# terminal-in-python

This a terminal made in python

It has many commands(some secret commands also >:) )

If you don't know all the command

you can type help in the terminal and it will show all the commands in the terminal.

For all the non-python users

I will make a separate repository with an .exe file in it.

Also for all python users, all the pip commands are written at the top in a multi-line comment :)
