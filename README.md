# terminal-in-python

This a terminal made in python
This is some cool things about it:

- It has many commands(some secret commands also >:) )

- If you don't know all the command you can type help in the terminal and it will show all the commands in the terminal.

### For all the non-python users. I will make a separate repository with an .exe file in it.

Also for all python users, all the pip commands are written at the top in a multi-line comment :)
